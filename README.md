# Streamlit-App

*Overview

        Our project combines the power of data analysis and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide advanced insights and solutions.
        This repository showcases our efforts to build a robust framework for analyzing data and integrating it with RAG techniques for enhanced decision-making and information retrieval.

*Features

        -Data Analysis: Perform in-depth analysis using various statistical to extract meaningful insights.

        -RAG Integration: Leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation to integrate external knowledge sources for contextualized data generation and retrieval.

        -End-to-End Pipeline: Build a seamless pipeline from data preprocessing to RAG-based output generation.

        -Customizable: Modular and flexible design to accommodate various datasets and retrieval models.
